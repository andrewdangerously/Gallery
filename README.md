Summary
This script creates a simple photo gallery application that:

Loads images from a specified directory.

Displays images in full screen while maintaining aspect ratio.

Changes images automatically every 15 seconds.

Minimizes on startup if the --minimized flag is passed.

Adjusts window size to avoid overlapping the taskbar.

This setup is ideal for running a digital photo frame or a gallery display on a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen.
